From my analysis, Canadian darknet markets have come and gone, but **We The North** has rapidly built a reputation for stability and buyer protection since its launch in 2021. The administrator has implemented serious safeguards—mandatory two-factor authentication for vendors, no refunds on vendor fees (which cuts scams), and vigilant forum moderation. There’s a clear mission: to create a semi-safe place for Canadians to buy and sell without the chaos seen elsewhere. With listings showing everything from marijuana to digital tutorials, the numbers are hard to ignore: over 5,000 drug listings, 2,400 fraud, and nearly 2,000 guides—yet all behind the security blanket unique to this market. Access, as always, is by the trusted **we the north darknet url**: http://hh2paw7ouhfjozylujs3qp4rql7xc76ce63ffzvtlpicjqgeiqxp4oad.onion.
